# m3_to_kWh_converter
A simple m3 to kWh converter in Python.

The constants used for the algorithm are from the N-Ergie company in my region :
Calorific value  = 11,305
Aditional number =  0,9299
Price / kWh      = 10,74 ct
Base price /Year = 170,99 Euro
Bonus            = 38,52 Euro
Prices are for a consumption of 5000 - 50.000 kWh per Year
